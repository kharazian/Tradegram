# HitCommerce
## Core module
This project is the core module of the **HitCommerce** project. Works as middle between ABP modules (Identity, BackgroundJobs, ...) and HitCommerce sub-modules (Catalog, Payments, ...) and the task of this module is to process the core requests.
### Status
This project is in **very early preview** stage so it's not suggested to use it in any type of projects.
All entities and service are in archetypal stage, so:
* We appreciate any feedback
* We appreciate any Contribution

Feel free and apply your changes. It is our pleasure to accept your helpful PRs.

Considering the project is the infrastructure of the next modules, we refuse to start new projects. Because we need to get a specific architecture in the core layer.
